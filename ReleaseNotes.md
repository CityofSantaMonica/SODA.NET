### New in 0.1.0 (Released 2014/08/28)
  - Initial release!
  - This library is under active development. As such, pre-v1.0 versions may introduce breaking changes until things stabilize around v1.0. Every effort will be made to ensure that any breaking change is well documented and that appropriate workarounds are suggested.
